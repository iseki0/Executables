# Bug Report - 3 Bugs Found in Codebase

## Bug 1: Unimplemented readAtMost Method in MockSection (Critical)

**Location:** `files/src/jvmTest/kotlin/space/iseki/executables/common/SectionInputStreamTest.kt` line 32

**Description:** The `MockSection` class has an unimplemented `readAtMost` method that throws a `TODO("Not yet implemented")` exception. This is a critical bug because the method is part of the `ReadableSection` interface and will cause runtime exceptions when called.

```kotlin
override fun readAtMost(pos: Long, buf: ByteArray, off: Int, len: Int): Int {
    TODO("Not yet implemented")
}
```

**Impact:** Any code that calls the `readAtMost` method on a `MockSection` instance will crash with a `NotImplementedError`. This affects the reliability of tests and potentially production code if this mock is used elsewhere.

**Risk Level:** High - Runtime crash potential

## Bug 2: Potential Integer Overflow in Address Addition (High)

**Location:** `files/src/commonMain/kotlin/space/iseki/executables/pe/PEFile.kt` lines 863-869

**Description:** The private operator function for adding two `Address32` values has a flawed overflow detection mechanism. The check `if (sum < this.value)` may not correctly detect overflow in all cases due to unsigned integer arithmetic behavior.

```kotlin
private operator fun Address32.plus(relAddress: Address32): Address32 {
    val sum = this.value + relAddress.value
    if (sum < this.value) {
        throw ArithmeticException("Address32 overflow: $this + $relAddress wraps around")
    }
    return Address32(sum)
}
```

**Impact:** In cases where the addition wraps around but the result is still greater than the first operand, the overflow will not be detected, leading to incorrect address calculations that could cause memory access violations or data corruption.

**Risk Level:** High - Memory safety and data integrity issues

## Bug 3: Race Condition in Concurrent File Processing (Medium)

**Location:** `g/src/main/kotlin/a/G.kt` lines 46-59

**Description:** The code uses `runBlocking(Dispatchers.Default)` and launches multiple coroutines to process files concurrently, but all coroutines write to the same output directory without proper synchronization. Multiple coroutines could attempt to create the same parent directory simultaneously or write to files with overlapping paths.

```kotlin
runBlocking(Dispatchers.Default) {
    for (file in input.asSequence().flatMap { it.walk() }.filter { it.isFile }) {
        val isEnum = file.name.endsWith(".enum.yml")
        val isFlag = file.name.endsWith(".flag.yml")
        if (!isEnum && !isFlag) continue
        launch {
            // ... file processing ...
            val typeOutFile = od.asFile.resolve(pkgPath + "/" + data.typename + ".kt")
            typeOutFile.parentFile.mkdirs() // POTENTIAL RACE CONDITION
            typeOutFile.outputStream().bufferedWriter(StandardCharsets.UTF_8).use { w ->
                cfg.getTemplate(if (isFlag) "flag.ftl" else "enum.ftl").process(data, w)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Multiple coroutines calling `mkdirs()` on the same directory path simultaneously could lead to:
- Race conditions where directory creation fails intermittently
- Potential file write conflicts if multiple files map to the same output path
- Unpredictable build failures in concurrent environments

**Risk Level:** Medium - Build reliability and consistency issues

---

## Summary

These bugs represent different categories of issues:
1. **Incomplete Implementation** - Unfinished code that will cause runtime failures
2. **Logic Error** - Flawed overflow detection that could lead to security/safety issues  
3. **Concurrency Issue** - Race condition that could cause build failures in multi-threaded environments

All three bugs should be addressed to improve the codebase's reliability, safety, and concurrent execution capabilities.
